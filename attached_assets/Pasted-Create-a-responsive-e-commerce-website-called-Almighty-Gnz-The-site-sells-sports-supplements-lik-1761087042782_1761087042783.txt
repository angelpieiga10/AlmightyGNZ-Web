Create a responsive e-commerce website called "Almighty Gnz".
The site sells sports supplements like protein, creatine, and pre-workout.

Requirements:
- Use separate files: index.html, style.css, script.js.
- Use a red and white color scheme, clean athletic style similar to MyProtein.
- Make the site mobile responsive (mobile-first) and accessible (semantic HTML, alt text, proper labels).

Pages / sections:
1. Homepage: hero banner with slogan and a clear call-to-action button that links to the products section.
2. Product catalog grid: product cards with image (use placeholder images), name, short description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
   - Include at least 4 example products: "Whey Protein 1kg", "Creatine Monohydrate 300g", "Pre-Workout 250g", "Recovery BCAA 300g".
3. Shopping cart page/section: lists selected items with quantity controls (+ / -), per-item subtotal, total price, and a "Checkout" button.
4. Checkout flow: simulate checkout with a simple form (name, email, address) and a final confirmation screen (no real payments).
5. Navbar: links to Home, Products, Cart, Contact.
6. Footer: social media icons (placeholders) and contact info.

Behavior & JavaScript:
- Implement cart logic in script.js:
  - Add to cart, remove item, update quantities.
  - Persist cart in localStorage so cart survives page reloads.
  - Update cart item count in the navbar live.
  - Calculate totals including a simulated shipping cost.
- Provide basic form validation on checkout (required fields).
- Use unobtrusive JS: HTML works without JS for navigation and content (graceful degradation).

Accessibility & UX:
- Use semantic elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>).
- Buttons and interactive controls accessible by keyboard.
- Provide alt attributes for images and aria-labels where appropriate.

Styling:
- Responsive grid for products (1 column on small, 2 on medium, 3+ on wide screens).
- Clear CTA buttons (red primary, white text) and subtle hover effects.
- Clean fonts and spacing; make the layout easy to read.

At the top of index.html include a comment listing the 3 files and a short usage note: "Run index.html, edit products in script.js (products array)."

End by adding a short README comment block explaining how to change product data and how cart persistence works.
